 Text-to-Video Generator using Python (Hindi/English Support)

This project allows you to generate voice-narrated slideshow videos from any input text.  
You can give a story or paragraph in "Hindi or English", and it will:

 Convert text to voice using "gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)"  
 Automatically display your "images" as a background slideshow  
 Combine both into a final ".mp4 video" with synced narration

Perfect for:
 ->Storytelling
 ->Audio-visual content creation
 ->Educational narrations
 ->YouTube Shorts / Reels

  Sample Images Provided

Weâ€™ve included a few sample images in the `images/` folder so you can test the project right away.

You can:
-> Replace them with your own `.jpg` or `.png` images
-> Add more images if your text is longer
-> Make sure image count is proportional to the narration length
